Here's a professional and user-friendly `README.md` file for your **equipment-less VR controller using MediaPipe**. This explains the functionality, setup, and usage of your project clearly:

# 🎮 Gesture → Keyboard Controller (Equipment-less VR)

This project enables you to control keyboard inputs using only your body movements—no external VR equipment required. Utilizing **MediaPipe** for pose estimation and a webcam, this tool can launch and interact with applications like Notepad or games using **body gestures**.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

Using **MediaPipe Pose**, the webcam tracks specific body landmarks and translates them into keyboard key presses via **PyAutoGUI**:

| Gesture              | Action Triggered |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Hands Joined         | `SPACE` key      |
| Both Shoulders Left  | `LEFT` arrow     |
| Both Shoulders Right | `RIGHT` arrow    |
| Shoulder Level Up    | `UP` arrow       |
| Shoulder Level Down  | `DOWN` arrow     |

These gestures can control any app or game that responds to keyboard inputs—like a simple VR experience without additional hardware.

## 🛠 Features

- 🕹 Launch and control games or apps using gestures
- 🎥 Real-time pose detection with your webcam
- 🧠 Uses MediaPipe's landmark-based Pose estimation
- 🛑 Easily start/stop gesture control with GUI buttons
- 🚫 No external devices or VR headsets needed

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pyautogui mediapipe
```

### Run the App

Save the script as `gesture_controller.py` and execute it:

```bash
python gesture_controller.py
```

---

## 🧩 Controls

The app includes a simple Tkinter GUI with the following buttons:

- **Open Notepad** – Launches Windows Notepad
- **Open Game...** – Choose and launch any `.exe` file
- **Start Controller** – Begins gesture tracking and key mapping
- **Stop Controller** – Halts gesture detection

> Press `ESC` while the camera window is focused to exit gesture detection manually.
