🎮 Gesture → Keyboard Controller (Equipment-less VR)
This project enables you to control keyboard inputs using only your body movements—no external VR equipment required. Utilizing MediaPipe for pose estimation and a webcam, this tool can launch and interact with applications like Notepad or games using body gestures.

🧠 How It Works
Using MediaPipe Pose, the webcam tracks specific body landmarks and translates them into keyboard key presses via PyAutoGUI:


Gesture	Action Triggered
Hands Joined	SPACE key
Both Shoulders Left	LEFT arrow
Both Shoulders Right	RIGHT arrow
Shoulder Level Up	UP arrow
Shoulder Level Down	DOWN arrow
These gestures can control any app or game that responds to keyboard inputs—like a simple VR experience without additional hardware.

🛠 Features
